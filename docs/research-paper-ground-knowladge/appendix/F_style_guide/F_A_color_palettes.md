# F: A. Color Palettes

#### **A. Color Palettes** *Design Philosophy: Use color to group logic, not just to decorate. Avoid fully saturated backgrounds.* **Background Fills (The "Zone" Strategy)** *Used to encapsulate stages (e.g., "Pre-training phase") or environments.* * **Most papers use:** Very light, desaturated pastels (Opacity ~10-15%). * **Aesthetically pleasing options include:** * **Cream / Beige** (e.g., ‘#F5F5DC‘) - *Warm, academic feel.* * **Pale Blue / Ice** (e.g., ‘#E6F3FF‘) - *Clean, technical feel.* * **Mint / Sage** (e.g., ‘#E0F2F1‘) - *Soft, organic feel.* * **Pale Lavender** (e.g., ‘#F3E5F5‘) - *distinctive, modern feel.* * **Alternative (~20%):** White backgrounds with colored *dashed borders* for a high-contrast, minimalist look (common in theoretical papers). **Functional Element Colors** * **For "Active" Modules (Encoders, MLP, Attention):** Medium saturation is preferred. * *Common pairings:* Blue/Orange, Green/Purple, or Teal/Pink. * *Observation:* Colors are often used to distinguish **status** rather than component type: * **Trainable Elements:** Often Warm tones (Red, Orange, Deep Pink ). * **Frozen/Static Elements:** Often Cool tones (Grey, Ice Blue, Cyan). * **For Highlights/Results:** High saturation (Primary Red, Bright Gold) is strictly reserved for "Error/Loss," "Ground Truth," or the final output.
