# F: D. Typography & Icons

#### **D. Typography & Icons** *Design Philosophy: Strict separation between "Labeling" and "Math."* **Typography** * **Labels (Module Names):** **Sans-Serif** (Arial, Roboto, Helvetica). * *Style:* Bold for headers, Regular for details. * **Variables (Math):** **Serif** (Times New Roman, LaTeX default). * *Rule:* If it is a variable in your equation (e.g., $x, \theta, \ mathcal{L}$), it **must** be Serif and Italicized in the diagram. **Iconography Options** * **For Model State:** * *Trainable:* Fire, Lightning. * *Frozen:* Snowflake, Padlock, Stop Sign (Greyed out). * **For Operations:** * *Inspection:* Magnifying Glass. * *Processing/Computation:* Gear, Monitor. * **For Content:** * *Text/Prompt:* Document, Chat Bubble. * *Image:* Actual thumbnail of an image (not just a square). --- ### 3. Common Pitfalls (How to look "Amateur") * **The "PowerPoint Default" Look:** Using standard Blue/Orange presets with heavy black outlines. * **Font Mixing:** Using Times New Roman for "Encoder" labels (makes the paper look dated to the 1990s). * **Inconsistent Dimension:** Mixing flat 2D boxes and 3D isometric cubes without a clear reason (e.g., 2D for logic, 3D for tensors is fine; random mixing is not). * **Primary Backgrounds:** Using saturated Yellow or Blue backgrounds for grouping (distracts from the content). * **Ambiguous Arrows:** Using the same line style for "Data Flow" and " Gradient Flow." 27

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists --- ### 4. Domain-Specific Styles **If you are writing an AGENT / LLM Paper:** * **Vibe:** Illustrative, Narrative, "Friendly.", Cartoony. * **Key Elements:** Use "User Interface" aesthetics. Chat bubbles for prompts, document icons for retrieval. * **Characters:** It is common to use cute 2D vector robots, human avatars, or emojis to humanize the agent’s reasoning steps. **If you are writing a COMPUTER VISION / 3D Paper:** * **Vibe:** Spatial, Dense, Geometric. * **Key Elements:** Frustums (camera cones), Ray lines, and Point Clouds. * **Color:** Often uses RGB color coding to denote axes or channel correspondence. Use heatmaps (Rainbow/Viridis) to show activation. **If you are writing a THEORETICAL / OPTIMIZATION Paper:** * **Vibe:** Minimalist, Abstract, "Textbook." * **Key Elements:** Focus on graph nodes (circles) and manifolds (planes/ surfaces). * **Color:** Restrained. mostly Grayscale/Black/White with one highlight color (e.g., Gold or Blue). Avoid "cartoony" elements. Style Guide for Statistical Plots # NeurIPS 2025 Statistical Plot Aesthetics Guide ## 1. The "NeurIPS Look": A High-Level Overview The prevailing aesthetic for 2025 is defined by **precision, accessibility, and high contrast**. The "default" academic look has shifted away from bare-bones styling toward a more graphic, publication-ready presentation. * **Vibe:** Professional, clean, and information-dense. * **Backgrounds:** There is a heavy bias toward **stark white backgrounds ** for maximum contrast in print and PDF reading, though the "Seabornstyle" light grey background remains an accepted variant. * **Accessibility:** A strong emphasis on distinguishing data not just by color, but by texture (patterns) and shape (markers) to support black-and -white printing and colorblind readers. --- ## 2. Detailed Style Options ### **Color Palettes** * **Categorical Data:** * **Soft Pastels:** Matte, low-saturation colors (salmon, sky blue, mint, lavender) are frequently used to prevent visual fatigue. * **Muted Earth Tones:** "Academic" palettes using olive, beige, slate grey, and navy. 28

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists * **High-Contrast Primaries:** Used sparingly when categories must be distinct (e.g., deep orange vs. vivid purple). * **Accessibility Mode:** A growing trend involves combining color with **geometric patterns** (hatches, dots, stripes) to differentiate categories. * **Sequential & Heatmaps:** * **Perceptually Uniform:** "Viridis" (blue-to-yellow) and "Magma/ Plasma" (purple-to-orange) are the standard. * **Diverging:** "Coolwarm" (blue-to-red) is used for positive/ negative value splits. * **Avoid:** The traditional "Jet/Rainbow" scale is almost entirely absent. ### **Axes & Grids** * **Grid Style:** * **Visibility:** Grid lines are almost rarely solid. Common choices include **fine dashed (‘--‘)** or **dotted (‘:‘)** lines in light gray. * **Placement:** Grids are consistently rendered *behind* data elements (low Z-order). * **Spines (Borders):** * **The "Boxed" Look:** A full enclosure (black spines on all 4 sides) is very common. * **The "Open" Look:** Removing the top and right spines for a minimalist appearance. * **Ticks:** * **Style:** Ticks are generally subtle, facing inward, or removed entirely in favor of grid alignment. ### **Layout & Typography** * **Typography:** * **Font Family:** Exclusively **Sans-Serif** (resembling Helvetica, Arial, or DejaVu Sans). Serif fonts are rarely used for labels. * **Label Rotation:** X-axis labels are rotated **45 degrees** only when necessary to prevent overlap; otherwise, horizontal orientation is preferred. * **Legends:** * **Internal Placement:** Floating the legend *inside* the plot area ( top-left or top-right) to maximize the "data-ink ratio." * **Top Horizontal:** Placing the legend in a single row above the plot title. * **Annotations:** * **Direct Labeling:** Instead of forcing readers to reference a legend, text is often placed directly next to lines or on top of bars. --- ## 3. Type-Specific Guidelines ### **Bar Charts & Histograms** * **Borders:** Two distinct styles are accepted: * **High-Definition:** Using **black outlines** around colored bars for a "comic-book" or high-contrast look. * **Borderless:** Solid color fills with no outline (often used with light grey backgrounds). 29

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists * **Grouping:** Bars are grouped tightly, with significant whitespace between categorical groups. * **Error Bars:** Consistently styled with **black, flat caps**. ### **Line Charts** * **Markers:** A critical observation: Lines almost always include ** geometric markers** (circles, squares, diamonds) at data points, rather than just being smooth strokes. * **Line Styles:** Use **dashed lines** (‘--‘) for theoretical limits, baselines, or secondary data, and **solid lines** for primary experimental data. * **Uncertainty:** Represented by semi-transparent **shaded bands** ( confidence intervals) rather than simple vertical error bars. ### **Tree & Pie/Donut Charts** * **Separators:** Thick **white borders** are standard to separate slices or treemap blocks. * **Structure:** Thick **Donut charts** are preferred over traditional Pie charts. * **Emphasis:** "Exploding" (detaching) a specific slice is a common technique to highlight a key statistic. ### **Scatter Plots** * **Shape Coding:** Use different marker shapes (e.g., circles vs. triangles) to encode a categorical dimension alongside color. * **Fills:** Markers are typically solid and fully opaque. * **3D Plots:** Depth is emphasized by drawing "walls" with grids or using drop-lines to the "floor" of the plot. ### **Heatmaps** * **Aspect Ratio:** Cells are almost strictly **square**. * **Annotation:** Writing the exact value (in white or black text) ** inside the cell** is highly preferred over relying solely on a color bar. * **Borders:** Cells are often borderless (smooth gradient look) or separated by very thin white lines. ### **Radar Charts** * **Fills:** The polygon area uses **translucent fills** (alpha ~0.2) to show grid lines underneath. * **Perimeter:** The outer boundary is marked by a solid, darker line. ### **Miscellaneous** * **Dot Plots:** Used as a modern alternative to bar charts; often styled as "lollipops" (dots connected to the axis by a thin line). --- ## 4. Common Pitfalls (What to Avoid) * **The "Excel Default" Look:** Avoid heavy 3D effects on bars, shadow drops, or serif fonts (Times New Roman) on axes. * **The "Rainbow" Map:** Avoid the Jet/Rainbow colormap; it is considered outdated and perceptually misleading. * **Ambiguous Lines:** A line chart *without* markers can look ambiguous if data points are sparse; always add markers. 30

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists * **Over-reliance on Color:** Failing to use patterns or shapes to distinguish groups makes the plot inaccessible to colorblind readers. * **Cluttered Grids:** Avoid solid black grid lines; they compete with the data. Always use light grey/dashed grids. F.2. Automated Style Guide Summarization To distill a comprehensive style guide from top-tier AI conference papers, we employ a hierarchical summarization pipeline. We ﬁrst partition the reference images (methodology diagrams or statistical plots) into batches. For each batch, we prompt Gemini-3-Pro to analyze the visual patterns—including color palettes, shapes, and typography—and generate a local design report. Finally, we aggregate these batch-level reports and query the model to synthesize a uniﬁed style guide that captures the prevailing aesthetic standards and diverse design choices. The prompts used for discrete batch analysis and ﬁnal global synthesis are presented below. Batch Analysis Prompt for Methodology Diagrams You are a Lead Information Designer analyzing the visual style of top-tier AI conference papers (NeurIPS 2025). I have attached a batch of methodology diagrams from the NeurIPS 2025 conference. **Your Task:** Summarize a visual design guideline that ignores the specific scientific algorithms. Focus ONLY on the **Aesthetic and Graphic Design** choices. **Critical:** Do NOT converge each element to a single fixed design choice. Instead, identify what common design choices exist for each element and which ones are more popular or preferred. Please focus on these specific dimensions: 1. **Color Palette:** Observe color schemes, saturation levels, etc. Notice aesthetically pleasing combinations and preserve multiple options. 2. **Shapes & Containers:** Observe shape choices (e.g., rounded vs. sharp rectangles), containers, borders (thickness, color), background fills, shadows, etc. 3. **Lines & Arrows:** Observe line thickness, colors, arrow styles, dashed line usage. 4. **Layout & Composition:** Observe layouts, element arrangement patterns, information density, whitespace usage. 5. **Typography & Icons:** Observe font weights, sizes, colors, usage patterns, and icon usage. Please note that papers of different domains may have different aesthetic preferences. For example, agent papers will use detailed, cartoon-like illustrative styles more often, while theorectical papers will use more minimalistic styles. When you are summarizing the style, please consider the domain of the paper. You can use "For [domain], common options include: [list]" format to describe the style. Return a concise bullet-point summary of the visual style diversity observed in this batch. 31

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists **Critical Philosophy:** This is NOT about prescribing a single "correct" design. Instead, summarize the **multiple accepted design choices** in this field. **AVOID These Anti-Patterns:** 1. **DO NOT create rigid semantic bindings** like "Light Blue is standard for encoders" or "LLMs use brain icons". 2. **DO NOT prescribe icon-to-concept mappings** like "[Brain icon] (LLM/ Reasoning Core)". 3. **Present COLOR as aesthetic OPTIONS, not functional rules**. - Focus on: "These color combinations look good together" rather than " This component type requires this color" **Output Structure:** 1. **The "NeurIPS Look":** A high-level description of the prevailing aesthetic vibe. 2. **Detailed Style Options:** * **Colors:** What aesthetically pleasing color palettes are common? List hex codes and describe combinations, NOT what component types they’ re "for". * **Shapes & Containers:** Common shape choices, border styles, shadow usage patterns. * **Lines & Arrows:** Common line styles, arrow types, and dashed line conventions. * **Layout & Composition:** Common layout patterns and information density preferences. * **Typography & Icons:** Common font choices. For icons: describe what icon OPTIONS are available for different purposes (format: "For [purpose ], common options include: [icon1], [icon2]...") 3. **Common Pitfalls:** What design choices make a diagram look "outdated" or "amateur"? 4. **Domain-Specific Styles:** What are the common styles used in different domains? For example, agent papers will use detailed, cartoon-like illustrative styles more often, while theorectical papers will use more minimalistic styles. **Formatting Guidelines for Options:** - If 80%+ prevalence: "Most papers use [Option A]..." - If multiple popular options: "Common choices include: [Option A] (~X%), [ Option B] (~Y%)..." - For icons/colors: Use "For representing [concept], observed options include: [list]" format - Frame everything as OBSERVATIONS not PRESCRIPTIONS - Emphasize aesthetic quality over semantic rules **Input Reports:** {all_reports} Final Synthesis Prompt for Statistical Plots Below are multiple visual analysis reports from a dataset of NeurIPS 2025 statistical plots. 33
