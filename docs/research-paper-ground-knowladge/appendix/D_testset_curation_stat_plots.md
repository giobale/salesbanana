# D: Testset Curation for Statistical Plots Generation

D. Testset Curation for Statistical Plots Generation This section introduces the testset curation process for statistical plots generation, which evaluates the capability to generate statistical plots from raw data (e.g., tables, CSV ﬁles) and high-level visual descriptions (e.g. a bar plot titled "Number of Publications by Year"). Since academic manuscripts rarely include raw data for their published plots, we repurpose ChartMimic (Yang et al.,2025b), a dataset originally designed for chart-to-code evaluation. Speciﬁcally, we use the “direct mimic” subset, which contains 2,400 plots sourced majorly from arXiv papers and matplotlib galleries, each paired with human-curated Python code for reproduction. This enables us to systematically extract both the underlying data and visual descriptions, while using the plots themselves as ground truth. Speciﬁcally, the pipeline is as follows: 22

We begin with all 2,400 plots from the “direct mimic” subset. Using Gemini3-Pro, we extract the raw data from the code into tabular format, generate a high-level description of each plot’s visual intent, while also marking the diﬃculty of generating the plot (Speciﬁcally, plots with many data points or subplots are marked as diﬃcult, while plots with only 1 subplot and few data points are marked as easy). Meanwhile, we also apply two ﬁltering criteria: (1) Reproducible Data: exclude plots where data is randomly generated or requires complex computations; (2) Standard Mapping: exclude plots using data for geometric construction (e.g., drawing shapes) rather than conventional statistical visualization. Similar to our methodology diagram curation, we ﬁlter out plots with aspect ratios ( 𝑤 : ℎ ) outside [1.0, 2.5] to support future exploration with image generation models. This yields 914 plots. Categorization. ChartMimic’s original 22 plot categories include many types rarely used in academic publications, such as Pip chart and Quiver chart. Based on the distribution of our 914 ﬁltered plots, we consolidate them into 7 common categories: Bar Chart,Line Chart,Tree & Pie Chart,Scatter Plot, Heatmap,Radar Chart, and Miscellaneous (all other types). Sampling. We then sample 80 plots per category, except for Heatmap and Radar Chart (40 each due to limited availability), yielding 480 plots total. During sampling, we intentionally increased the proportion of diﬃcult cases to ensure a challenging testset. Each category is then evenly split into reference and test sets. 23
