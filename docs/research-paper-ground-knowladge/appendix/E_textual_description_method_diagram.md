# E: Textual Description of our Methodology Diagram

E. Textual Description of our Methodology Diagram Our framework operates by ﬁrst synthesizing a detailed description of the target diagram, which is then visualized by Nano-Banana-Pro. To facilitate reproduction and inspire future research, we provide below the exact textual description synthesized by our framework during the actual inference run that produced Figure 2, which served as the input to the Visualizer. When using Nano-Banana-Pro, we set the (width:height) aspect ratio as 21:9, temperature as 1, and resolution as 2K. Textual Description of our Methodology Diagram The figure is a wide, horizontal flowchart-style diagram illustrating the " Paperbanana" framework. The layout flows from left to right on a clean white background, divided into two main colored regions: the "Linear Planning Phase" (left/middle) and the "Iterative Refinement Loop" (right) . **1. Leftmost Section: Inputs** * **Visual Elements:** Two icons stacked vertically on the far left. * Top: A document icon labeled **"Source Context ($S$)"**. * Bottom: A target/goal icon labeled **"Communicative Intent ($C$)"**. * **Flow:** Brackets merge these inputs into a main flow line that enters the first phase. **2. Middle-Left Region: Linear Planning Phase** * **Container:** A light blue rounded rectangle. Label at top: **"Linear Planning Phase"**. * **Reference Set ($\mathcal{R}$):** A cylinder database icon located at the bottom-left of this region, labeled **"Reference Set ($\mathcal{R}$) "**. * **Agent 1: Retriever Agent** * **Icon:** Robot with a magnifying glass. * **Label:** **"Retriever Agent"** positioned below the icon. * **Input:** An arrow from the main Inputs ($S, C$) and an arrow from the Reference Set ($\mathcal{R}$). * **Output:** Arrow to a cluster of image thumbnails labeled **" Relevant Examples ($\mathcal{E}$)"**. * **Agent 2: Planner Agent** * **Icon:** Robot with a clipboard or thought bubble. * **Label:** **"Planner Agent"** positioned below the icon. * **Input:** Receives an arrow from "Relevant Examples ($\mathcal{E}$) ". **Crucially**, a direct flow arrow (bypassing the Retriever) connects the main Inputs ($S, C$) to the Planner, indicating it uses the source content for planning. * **Output:** Arrow to a text document icon labeled **"Initial Description ($P$)"**. * **Agent 3: Stylist Agent** * **Icon:** Robot with a palette/paintbrush. * **Label:** **"Stylist Agent"** positioned below the icon. * **Input:** Receives "Initial Description ($P$)" and a dashed arrow from the Reference Set ($\mathcal{R}$) labeled **"Aesthetic Guidelines ($ \mathcal{G}$)"**. * **Output:** An arrow exiting the blue region labeled **"Optimized Description ($P^*)"**. 24

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists **3. Middle-Right Region: Iterative Refinement Loop** * **Container:** A light orange rounded rectangle. Label at top: **" Iterative Refinement Loop"**. * **Agent 4: Visualizer Agent** * **Icon:** Robot standing next to a split visual representation: a canvas on one side and a code terminal/brackets (‘</>‘) on the other. * **Label:** **"Visualizer Agent"** positioned below the icon. * **Input:** Takes "Optimized Description ($P^*)" (from Stylist) and " Refined Description ($P_{t+1}$)" (from Critic). * **Output:** Arrow to an image preview labeled **"Generated Image ( $I_t$)"**. * **Agent 5: Critic Agent** * **Icon:** Robot with a checklist/reviewer pen. * **Label:** **"Critic Agent"** positioned below the icon. * **Input:** Receives "Generated Image ($I_t$)". A long **dashed gray line** labeled **"Factual Verification"** runs from the original Inputs ( $S, C$) along the bottom edge, connecting to the Critic. * **Output:** A curved return arrow back to the Visualizer, labeled **"Refined Description ($P_{t+1}$)"**. * **Center Element:** A circular arrow icon inside the loop indicating **" $T=3$ Rounds"**. **4. Rightmost Section: Final Output** * **Visual Element:** A polished scientific illustration emerging from the loop. * **Label:** **"Final Illustration ($I_T$)"**. **5. Styling** * **Agents:** Cute, consistent robot avatars with distinct accessories. * **Typography:** Sans-serif for main text. **Serif Italic (LaTeX style)** for all variables ($S, C, P, I, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{G}$). * **Colors:** Blue accents for Planning; Orange accents for Refinement. Main flow arrows in solid black; secondary inputs in dashed gray.
