# A: Dedicated Case Studies

A. Dedicated Case Studies Cases Demonstrating the Eﬀectiveness of PaperBanana We provide 2 cases in Figure 7to demonstrate the capability of PaperBanana for aiding the generation of academic illustrations. Given the same source context and caption, the vanilla Nano-Banana-Pro often produces diagrams with outdated color tones and overly verbose content. In contrast, our PaperBanana generates results that are more concise and aesthetically pleasing, while maintaining faithfulness to the source context. Case 1 Case 2 Human NanoBanana -Pro 🍌 PaperBanana Analysis In general, while being faithful to the source context, PaperBanana demonstrates clear advantages over vanilla Nano-Banana-Pro across multiple dimensions. 1. From an aesthetic perspective, Case 1 and Case 2 both show that PaperBanana employs more modern and harmonious color palettes (e.g., soft blue and orange zones) compared to the outdated grey tones in Nano-Banana-Pro. 2. Regarding conciseness, PaperBanana effectively distills core information while eliminating redundant textual descriptions, making the diagrams cleaner and more focused. 3. In terms of logical clarity, PaperBanana utilizes distinct colored blocks and zones to separate different functional modules (e.g., ``Lens Module'' and ``Reasoning Module'' in Case 1; ``Confidence Estimation (ECE)'' and ``Volume \& Disparity'' in Case 2), thereby enhancing the readability and comprehensibility of complex methodological workflows.

In contrast, our PaperBanana generates results that are more concise and aesthetically pleasing, while maintaining faithfulness to the source context. 17

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Enhancing the Aesthetics of Human-Drawn Diagrams We provide additional cases in Figure 8to demonstrate the interesting scenario of enhancing the aesthetics of human-drawn diagrams with our auto-summarized style guidelines. It is observed that the polished diagrams demonstrate signiﬁcant stylistic improvements in color schemes, typography, graphical elements, etc. Original Diagrams Style Enhanced Diagrams Figure 8 | Additional cases for enhancing the aesthetics of human-drawn diagrams with our autosummarized style guidelines. The polished diagrams demonstrate signiﬁcant stylistic improvements in color schemes, typography, graphical elements, etc. Case study for visualizing statistical plots with code and image generation. Figure 9compares the results of visualizing statistical plots with code and image generation. It is observed that the image generation model can generate more visually appealing plots, but incurs more faithfulness errors such as numerical hallucination or element repetition. 18

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Plots Visualized via IMG Plots Visualized via Coding Case Analysis Both plots are correct. The left plot looks more visually appealing Both plots are correct. The left plot looks more visually appealing The left plot looks better, but contains faithfulness issues: On the `Rebound` axis, it depicts Player A (Blue) as having a significantly higher value (~0.9) than Player B (Orange, ~0.6), effectively inverting the relationship and plotting the wrong values (likely duplicating the 'Steals' data). The left plot contains faithfulness issues: It duplicates the “East 10” category. The left plot contains faithfulness errors: The 'Clinical' data value is 0.4, but the Model draws the bar significantly taller than the 0.4 gridline and axis tick Figure 9 | Case study for visualizing statistical plots with code and image generation. It is observed that the image generation model can generate more visually appealing plots, but incurs more faithfulness errors such as numerical hallucination or element repetition. The red bounding boxes are added by the authors to highlight the errors. 19

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Failure Cases of PaperBanana.Figure 10 shows 3 failure cases of PaperBanana. We observe that the primary failure mode involves connection errors, such as redundant connections and mismatched source-target nodes. Our preliminary analysis reveals that the critic model often fails to identify these connectivity issues, suggesting these errors may originate from the foundation model’s inherent perception limitations. Resolving this challenge likely necessitates advancements in the underlying foundation model. Diagrams from PaperBanana Failure Reasons The attention block incorrectly draws connections from the Noise Predictor ( ) to three destination boxes, 𝑓𝑠𝑑 labeling two of them as 'Keys ( )' 𝐾𝑖 and one as 'Values ( )'. The text (Eq. 𝑉𝑖 2) explicitly states that diffusion features map only to Keys and Values, while Queries ( ) come from 𝑄𝑖 learnable parameters. It fails to draw generative connections (solid lines) from Actions ( ) to 𝑎 Task-Relevant States ( ). The method 𝑠 explicitly states (Eq. 3) that state transitions depend on previous actions ( ). By isolating the ℎ'𝑡=𝑓(...,𝑎𝑡−1) actions without driving the state dynamics, the diagram fails to represent the fundamental structure of a control/world model described in the text. The text explicitly states, "We note that the Decoder and Predictor can only access information of t through e" and defines the Decoder's input as the embedding and the goal ( D(e,g))). However, the Model diagram draws a dotted skip connection from the "Tactic t" block directly to the Decoder, replacing the required "Goal" connection. This violates the functional constraints described in the methodology. Figure 10 | Failure cases of PaperBanana.
