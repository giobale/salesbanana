# C: Implementation Details

C. Implementation Details Categorization of Methodology Diagrams. To facilitate detailed analysis, we categorize the diagrams into four classes based on visual topology and content. The detailed deﬁnitions and keywords for each category are listed in Table 3. Additional Experiment Settings. For all experiments, we set the generation temperature to 1. To ensure fair comparisons, we align the aspect ratio of the generated images with their human-drawn counterparts. Speciﬁcally, we calculate the aspect ratio of the ground-truth diagram and match it to the nearest ratio supported by the image generation model (e.g., for Nano-Banana-Pro, we round to the closest among 3:2, 16:9, and 21:9). Generating Diagrams and Plots used in this Paper. All ﬁgures in this paper marked with “[Generated by ]” are produced entirely by PaperBanana. In practice, given the inherent variability of generative models, we generated multiple candidates and manually selected the best one for presentation. We recommend this “generate-and-select” workﬂow for practical applications of PaperBanana.
