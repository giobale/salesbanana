PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Models (LLMs) (Anthropic,2025;Comanici et al.,2025;Liu et al.,2024;OpenAI,2025b;Yang et al., 2025a), autonomous AI Scientists have demonstrated the potential to automate many facets of the research lifecycle, such as literature review, idea generation, and experiment iteration (Gottweis et al., 2025;Lu et al.,2024;Luo et al.,2025). Yet scientiﬁc discoveries achieve their full value only through eﬀective communication. Despite their proﬁciency in textual analysis and code execution, current autonomous AI scientists struggle to visually communicate discoveries, especially for generating illustrations (diagrams and plots) that adhere to the rigorous standards of academic manuscripts. Among these illustration tasks, generating methodology diagrams represents a signiﬁcant challenge, demanding both content ﬁdelity and visual aesthetics. Prior endeavors for diagram generation have predominantly adopted the code-based paradigm, leveraging TikZ (Belouadi and Eger,2024; Belouadi et al.,2025), Python-PPTX (Zheng et al.,2025), or SVG to programmatically synthesize diagrams. While eﬀective for structured content, these methods can encounter expressiveness limitations when attempting to produce the intricate visual elements – such as specialized icons and custom shapes – that are increasingly common in modern AI publications. Conversely, although recent image generation models (Deepmind,2025;OpenAI,2025a;Team et al.,2025;Wu et al.,2025a) have demonstrated advanced instruction-following capabilities and high-quality visual outputs, consistently generating academic illustrations that meet scholarly standards remains a diﬃcult task (Zuo et al., 2025). Specialized expertise required for professional illustration tools often constrains researchers’ ability to freely express complex ideas, forcing them to invest substantial manual eﬀort into crafting ﬁgures. This creates a signiﬁcant bottleneck in the eﬀective visual communication of scientiﬁc discoveries. In this paper, we introduce PaperBanana, an agentic framework designed to bridge this gap by automating the production of high-quality academic illustrations. Given a methodology description and diagram caption as input, PaperBanana orchestrates specialized agents powered by state-ofthe-art VLMs and image generation models (e.g. Gemini-3-Pro and Nano-Banana-Pro) to retrieve reference examples, devise detailed plans for content and style, render images, and iteratively reﬁne via self-critique. This reference-driven collaborative workﬂow allows the system to eﬀectively master the logical composition and stylistic norms required for publication-ready illustrations. Beyond methodology diagrams, our framework demonstrates signiﬁcant versatility by extending to statistical plots, oﬀering a comprehensive solution for scientiﬁc visualization. To rigorously evaluate our framework and address the absence of dedicated benchmarks for automated academic illustration, we introduce PaperBananaBench, a comprehensive benchmark for methodology diagram generation. The benchmark comprises 292 test cases and 292 reference cases curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, spanning diverse research topics and illustration styles. To assess generation quality, we employ a VLM-as-a-Judge approach for reference-based scoring against human illustrations across four dimensions: faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics, with reliability veriﬁed through correlation with human judgments. Comprehensive experiments on our benchmark demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of PaperBanana. Our method consistently outperforms leading baselines across all four evaluation dimensions— faithfulness (+2.8%), conciseness (+37.2%), readability (+12.9%), and aesthetics (+6.6%)—as well as the aggregated overall score (+17.0%) for diagram generation. We further show that our method also seamlessly extends to statistical plots. Collectively, our method paves the way for automating the generation of academic illustrations (Examples shown in Figure 1). As a demonstration of its capability, ﬁgures marked with in this manuscript were entirely generated using PaperBanana. Additionally, we discuss intriguing settings including using our framework to enhance existing humancreated illustrations and using image generation models for statistical plot generation. To sum up, our contributions are: 2
