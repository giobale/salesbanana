Prior work primarily adopts code-based generation using TikZ (Belouadi and Eger,2024;Belouadi et al.,2025;Hsu and Eger,2023;Zhang et al.,2025) or Python-PPT (Pang et al.,2025;Zheng et al.,2025) for programmatic synthesis. While eﬀective for structured content, these approaches face expressiveness limitations in generating the intricate visual designs prevalent in modern AI publications. Recent image generation models have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-ﬁdelity, visually sophisticated ﬁgures (Deepmind,2025;OpenAI,2025a;Tang et al.,2026;Team et al.,2025; Zuo et al.,2025), oﬀering a promising alternative. Concurrent to our work, AutoFigure (Anonymous, 2026) 2 transforms scientiﬁc content into symbolic representations before rendering them as images using GPT-Image. In comparison, our method achieves broader generalizability through adaptive retrieval and academic-style transfer, with greater extensibility by supporting both methodology diagrams and statistical plots in a uniﬁed pipeline. For evaluation benchmarks, quality assessment of auto-generated diagrams remains less explored. Most closely related to PaperBananaBench is SridBench (Chang et al.,2025), which evaluates 2Currently, AutoFigure is still an anonymous preprint.

We will report results once it is publicly available. 7.2. Coding-Based Data Visualization While the inherent complexity of academic diagram generation has deterred pioneering research, visualizing statistical data has garnered extensive attention since the rise of language models. Early endeavors (Dibia and Demiralp,2019) employed LSTM-based models to convert JSON data into Vega-Lite visualizations, followed by few-shot and zero-shot coding approaches (Dibia,2023;Galimzyanov et al.,2025;Li et al.,2024;Tian et al.,2024) leveraging large-scale backbones such as ChatGPT (OpenAI,2022). More recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated remarkable progress in coding-based data visualization (Chen et al.,2025;Goswami et al.,2025;Seo et al.,2025;Yang et al.,2024), leveraging fundamental mechanisms such as test-time scaling (Snell et al.,2024) and self-reﬂection (Shinn et al.,2023). While this paper is more focused on automated generation of academic diagrams and plots, these agentic frameworks can be seamlessly integrated into our Visualizer Agent to enhance its capability in translating detailed descriptions of desired plots into robust Python code. Complementary to generation, recent eﬀorts have also explored reversing plots back into their original code (Wu et al.,2025b;Yang et al.,2025b), challenging both the perception and coding capabilities of VLMs.
