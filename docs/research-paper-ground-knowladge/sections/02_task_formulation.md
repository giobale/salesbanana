# 2. Task Formulation

2. Task Formulation We formalize the task of automated academic illustration generation as learning a mapping from a source context and a communicative intent to a visual representation. Let 𝑆 denote the source context containing the essential information, and 𝐶 denote the communicative intent that speciﬁes the scope and focus of the desired illustration. The goal is to generate an image 𝐼 that faithfully visualizes 𝑆 while fulﬁlling the communicative intent 𝐶, formulated as: 𝐼=𝑓(𝑆, 𝐶).(1) To further guide the mapping function, the input can be optionally augmented by a set of 𝑁 reference examples E={𝐸𝑛}𝑁 𝑛=1 . Each example 𝐸𝑛 serves as a ground-truth demonstration, deﬁned as a tuple 𝐸𝑛=(𝑆𝑛, 𝐶𝑛, 𝐼𝑛) , where 𝐼𝑛 is the reference illustration corresponding to the context 𝑆𝑛 and communicative intent 𝐶𝑛. Integrating this, the uniﬁed task formulation becomes: 𝐼=𝑓(𝑆, 𝐶, E),(2) where Edefaults to ∅when no examples are used (i.e., zero-shot generation). Among various types of academic illustrations, this paper primarily focuses on the automated generation of methodology diagrams, which requires interpreting complex technical concepts and logical ﬂows from textual descriptions into high-ﬁdelity, visually pleasing illustrations. In this setting, the source context 𝑆 is the textual description of the method (e.g., methodology sections), and the communicative intent 𝐶 is the ﬁgure caption specifying the scope and focus (e.g., “Overview of our framework”).
