2026-2-2 PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Dawei Zhu12*, Rui Meng2, Yale Song2, Xiyu Wei1, Sujian Li1, Tomas Pﬁster2and Jinsung Yoon2 1Peking University, 2Google Cloud AI Research https://dwzhu-pku.github.io/PaperBanana/ Despite rapid advances in autonomous AI scientists powered by language models, generating publicationready illustrations remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in the research workﬂow. To lift this burden, we introduce PaperBanana, an agentic framework for automated generation of publication-ready academic illustrations. Powered by state-of-the-art VLMs and image generation models, PaperBanana orchestrates specialized agents to retrieve references, plan content and style, render images, and iteratively reﬁne via self-critique. To rigorously evaluate our framework, we introduce PaperBananaBench, comprising 292 test cases for methodology diagrams curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, covering diverse research domains and illustration styles. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana consistently outperforms leading baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics. We further show that our method eﬀectively extends to the generation of high-quality statistical plots. Collectively, PaperBanana paves the way for the automated generation of publication-ready illustrations. 13 Methodology Diagrams Statistical Plots Figure 1 | Examples of methodology diagrams and statistical plots generated by PaperBanana, which show the potential of automating the generation of academic illustrations.
