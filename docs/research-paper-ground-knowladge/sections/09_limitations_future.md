# 9. Limitations and Future Directions

9. Limitations and Future Directions As a pioneering work, although PaperBanana achieves promising results, it inevitably faces certain limitations. This section will discuss these limitations in detail, and outline the corresponding future directions we envision. Towards Editable Academic Illustrations. The most prominent limitation of PaperBanana lies in the raster nature of its output. Unlike vector graphics—which are preferred in academic contexts for their inﬁnite scalability and precise detail preservation—raster images are inherently diﬃcult to edit. While generating outputs at 4K resolution serves as a viable workaround to ensure high visual ﬁdelity, it does not fundamentally resolve the challenge of post-generation modiﬁcation. To address this, we envision three potential solutions catering to varying levels of editing needs. For minor visual adjustments, leveraging state-of-the-art image editing models, such as Nano-Banana-Pro, serves as the most direct approach. For more structural modiﬁcations, a reconstruction pipeline as exempliﬁed by Paper2Any (Liu et al.,2025) and Edit Banana (BIT-DataLab,2025) can be adopted: employing OCR for text extraction and SAM3 for pattern segmentation, followed by reassembling these elements on presentation slides (e.g., via Python-PPTX). While currently facing challenges when handling complex backgrounds and intricate visual elements, we anticipate that training specialized element extraction 11

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists models will signiﬁcantly enhance the robustness of this reconstruction. Finally, a more advanced direction involves developing a GUI Agent capable of autonomously operating professional vector design software (Huang et al.,2026;Sun et al.,2025), such as Adobe Illustrator. This would enable the direct generation of fully editable vector graphics, although it necessitates the agent to possess exceptional perception, planning and interaction capabilities. The Trade-oﬀ between Style Standardization and Diversity. The second limitation lies in the trade-oﬀ between style standardization and diversity. While our uniﬁed style guide ensures rigid compliance with academic standards, it inevitably reduces the stylistic diversity of the output. Future work could explore more dynamic style adaptation mechanisms that allow for a broader range of artistic expressions and personalized aesthetic choices while maintaining professional rigor. The Challenge of Fine-Grained Faithfulness. While PaperBanana excels in aesthetics, a performance gap in faithfulness compared to human experts remains. As shown in our failure analysis (Figure 10 in the Appendix), the most prevalent errors involve ﬁne-grained connectivity, such as misaligned start/end points or incorrect arrow directions. These subtleties often escape the detection of current critic models, limiting the eﬃcacy of self-correction. We posit that closing this gap primarily hinges on advancing the ﬁne-grained visual perception capabilities of the foundation VLMs. Advancing Evaluation Paradigms. Following existing practices, our evaluation adopts a referencebased VLM-as-a-Judge setup. Despite its eﬀectiveness, we acknowledge that this evaluation paradigm still faces inherent challenges. First, regarding faithfulness, quantifying structural correctness remains challenging, as detecting subtle errors in connectivity and notation requires high-precision scrutiny. Future protocols could beneﬁt from incorporating ﬁne-grained, structure-based (Liang and You,2025) or rubric-based (Huang et al.,2026;Li et al.,2025) metrics, which may oﬀer higher accuracy despite their increased computational complexity. Second, for subjective dimensions such as aesthetics, we observe that textual prompting is often insuﬃcient to fully align the VLM with human preferences. We envision that training customized reward models to bridge this alignment gap represents a crucial direction for future research. Test-Time Scaling for Diverse Preferences. Currently, our framework produces a single output for each query. However, given the inherent stochasticity of generative models and the subjectivity of aesthetic preferences, a single result may not universally satisfy diverse user tastes. A natural extension is to implement test-time scaling by generating a spectrum of candidates with varying styles and compositions. This paradigm shifts the focus from single-shot generation to a generate-and-select workﬂow, enabling either human users or VLM-based preference models to select the illustration that best aligns with their speciﬁc requirements. Extension to Broader Domains. Beyond academic illustrations, our framework establishes a generalizable paradigm: leveraging retrieval to instruct the model on what to generate (target diagram types) and employing automatic style summarization to teach it how to generate (stylistic norms). By eﬀectively decoupling structural planning from aesthetic rendering, this reference-driven approach bypasses the need for expensive domain-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning. We believe this paradigm holds signiﬁcant promise for other specialized domains requiring strict adherence to community standards, such as UI/UX design, patent drafting, and industrial schematics.

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists Impact Statement This paper introduces PaperBanana, a framework designed to automate the generation of academic illustrations. Our goal is to democratize access to high-quality visual communication tools, particularly beneﬁting researchers who may lack professional design resources. By reducing the manual eﬀort required for diagram creation, we aim to accelerate the scientiﬁc workﬂow. However, we acknowledge the ethical risk associated with generative models, speciﬁcally the potential for “visual hallucination” or unfaithful representation of technical details. It is imperative that users of such systems reject blind reliance and maintain rigorous human oversight to ensure the scientiﬁc integrity of published illustrations.
