6. Discussion 6.1. Enhancing Aesthetics of Human-Drawn Diagrams Given the summarized aesthetic guidelines G , an intriguing question arises: can these guidelines serve to elevate the aesthetic quality of existing human-drawn diagrams? To explore this, we implement a streamlined pipeline where Gemini-3-Pro ﬁrst formulates up to 10 actionable suggestions based on 9

We evaluate the results using our referencebased protocol, comparing the reﬁned output against the original human-drawn diagram. Across the 292 test cases, the reﬁned diagrams achieved a win / tie / loss ratio of 56.2% / 6.8% / 37.0% in aesthetics against their original counterparts, showing that the summarized aesthetic guidelines can indeed serve to elevate the aesthetic quality of existing human-authored diagrams. An illustrative example is provided in Figure 6. More examples are provided in AppendixFigure 8. 6.2. Coding vs Image Generation for Visualizing Statistical Plots For statistical plots, code-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable eﬃcacy, as evidenced by Figure 4and prior studies (Chen et al.,2025;Goswami et al.,2025;Yang et al.,2024). Given the advanced ﬁdelity and visual appeal of recent image generation models, we compare code-based (Gemini-3-Pro) and image-generation-based (Nano-Banana-Pro) approaches for the Visualizer agent in PaperBanana, as shown in Figure 5. Results reveal distinct trade-oﬀs: image generation excels in presentation (Readability and Aesthetics) but underperforms in content ﬁdelity (Faithfulness and Conciseness). Manual inspection shows that while image models faithfully render sparse plots, they struggle with dense or complex data, exhibiting numerical hallucinations or element repetition (Appendix Figure 9). Thus, hybridly using image generation for sparse visualizations and code for dense plots may oﬀer the best balance.
